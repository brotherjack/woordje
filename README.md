A web-based text editor for creating quick and small blog posts. Like little poops of wisdom and/or happiness.

The basic idea is that it will be a little web-app, designed to be run on your machine, which will launch
a text editor. The editor will allow you to do editor stuff, to write posts. 

What is this editor stuff? Basically in addition to the 'box in which you put in text', there will be a 'box
which shows you what the markup will loook like'. The idea is to start with something simple like rst, and then
maybe LaTeX, if that isn't too daunting.

There will also be a counter marking down how many words you have left in your post. The idea is to write posts
under 500 words with this app (there will be an settings page where you can set this limit).
